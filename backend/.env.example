# Career Mentor API Environment Config
# 
# ZERO API KEYS REQUIRED
# 
# The auto-updater (auto_updater.py) runs on pure web scraping.
# It uses the public Wikipedia REST API endpoints to find and parse
# movie summaries based on career categories, and then local NLP 
# to inject them into the database automatically.
#
# No external LLM keys (OpenAI/Gemini) or database keys 
# are required for the system to populate itself with new movies.
